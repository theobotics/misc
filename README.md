### Views from Major Scholars/Theologians
#### I. Grudem - Yes, there are degrees of reward but don't misunderstand.

*Systematic Theology*, Wayne Grudem, page 1145:

"Even though there will be degrees of reward in heaven, the joy of each person will be full and complete for eternity. If we ask how this can be when there are different degrees of reward, it simply shows that our perception of happiness is based on the assumption that happiness depends on what we posses or the status or power have. In actuality, however, our true happiness consists in delighting in God and rejoicing in the status and recognition that he has given us."

"It would be morally and spiritually beneficial for us to have a greater consciousness of this clear New Testament teaching on degrees of heavenly reward. Rather than making us competitive with one another, it would cause us to help and encourage one another that we all may increase our heavenly reward, for God has an infinite capacity to bring blessing to us all, and we are all members of one another (see 1 Corinthians 12:26-27)"

#### II. Grudem - Yes, there are degrees of reward but don't misunderstand.
